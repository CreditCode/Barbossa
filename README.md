# Counter Strike Global Offensive Open Source Multihack

### Setup

Requirements:

* cmake
* Shared library injector 
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
* [Library injector](https://github.com/scen/osxinj) (I'm suggesting this not saying only this will work I will not explain how to build it)

To generate the project files:

* **Mac OS**: `cmake .`

To build:

* **Mac OS**: `make`

Injection can be done by injecting it with your favorite shared library injector.
* **Example**: `sudo ./osxinj csgo_osx64 libNoriaela`
