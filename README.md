# Barbossa (Outdated)
## I'm officially done updating this.

Info:
No I did not make this viking posted this to my discord "Mac Hacks" months ago after his website he made went down I am greatful that he made, all I am doing is improving it or making changes. The current menu Barbossa currently is using is a placeholder I will be either remaking the menu or going back to the old one I still haven't decided yet.
